        <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
        <p>
            Here, among the ordinary homes and winding lanes, lived a young boy named <span id="span1">_______</span> Potter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Harry's life took an unexpected turn on his eleventh birthday when a series of mysterious <span id="span2">_______</span> arrived, inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
        <p>
            With each letter intercepted, the <span id="span3">_______</span> grew increasingly paranoid, but Harry's curiosity was piqued.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon, he learned of his true heritage: his parents were renowned  <span id="span4">_______</span> who perished at the hands of the dark wizard Voldemort.
        </p>
