An abstract class is a template definition of methods and variables in a specific class, or category of objects. Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstracted behaviors or methods. Objects or classes can be abstracted, which means that they're summarized into characteristics relevant to the current program's operation. Abstract classes are used in all object-oriented (OOP) languages, including Java, C++, C# and VB.NET. Declaring a class as abstract means it can't be directly instantiated, which means an object can't be created from it. This protects code from being used incorrectly. Classes that are derived from abstract classes use a concept called inheritance, which shares a set of attributes and methods. When done many times, this results in a hierarchy of classes where the abstract class is considered a root or base class. Abstract classes can be created in the following ways, depending on the language, using the abstract keyword in the class definition, inheriting from the abstract type, and including an abstract method in the class definition. 

Primitive wrapper class is a wrapper class that encapsulates, hides or wraps data types from the eight primitive data types, so that these can be used to create instantiated objects with methods in another class or in other classes.The primitive wrapper classes are found in the Java API. The primitive wrapper classes and their corresponding primitive types are byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.
